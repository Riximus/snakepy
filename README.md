# Snake
A snake game written in Python using the pygame library.


## Installing
Download the Python installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the pygame library
```
pip install pygame
```


## Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python SnakeGame.py
```

The `difficulty` variable can be changed with the values provided in the comment to set the difficulty level.

## Cloning
You are allowed to clone this game for yourself! I recommend using SSH to clone.
```
git clone git@github.com:selsayed25/snakepy.git
```

The rest of the code is properly commented and self explanatory.
